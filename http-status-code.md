Informational responses indicate the acceptance and continuation of the requests.

100 Continue
The server tells the client that everything is OK so far keeps sending requests.

101 Switching Protocol

103 Early Hints
The server hints the client to preload the resources while the server preparing the data to be returned.

Successful Responses (2xx)
As the term suggests, these status codes indicate that the request is successfully received, accepted, and resolved.

200 OK
This status code indicates the successful HTTP request. It's a standard successful response for GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, and TRACE.

201 Created
This status code is sent by the server to indicates that a new resource has been created. Generally used for the POST and PUT requests.

202 Accepted
Typically used for the async response. The server confirms to the client that the request has been accepted.

203 Non-Authoritative Information
The server usually returns this to indicate that server is a proxy that received this data from its origin. The proxy returns the modified version of the origin's data.

Redirection messages (3xx)
The server usually returns a 3xx redirection status code to indicate that some additional action has to be done by the client to fulfill the request.

300 Multiple Choice
The server returns this code when it has multiple options for response.

301 Moved Permanently
Server sends the new URL with a 301 status code if the requested URL has been shifted to new URL.

302 indicates that the requested URL has been changed temporarily. Therefore, can't fulfill the request for this moment.

303 See Other
Server tells the client to get the desired resource at another URL with a GET request.

304 Not Modified
304 Indicates that the resources are the same since the last visit. In this case, the client can use the cached resources.

307 Temporary Redirect
The server tells the client that you will get the desired resource at another URL with the same request that the client has just made. URL shifting is temporary.

308 Permanent Redirect
The server tells the client that you will get the desired resource at another URL with the same request that the client has just made. URL shifting is permanent.
